Hello, World!

Empty pages are scary. Some of the first sentences that I deleted were probably better. The ones I didn't write were awesome. Unfortunately for you, you will never get to read those might-have-beens, because I typed *these* words, and not some others. Oops.

Well, since we've established that I don't have a hope of improving on the blank page, Hi! I'm Kai. I write code. Now I'm writing a blog. It's probably going to be about programming. At the moment, I'm writing a lot of Ruby code, and getting a handle on Crystal, so you can probably expect some comparison articles. So to get things kicked off here, here is the classic "Hello, World" application in both Ruby and Crystal:

Ruby:
```ruby
puts "Hello, World!"
```

Crystal:
```crystal
puts "Hello, World!"
```

*Viva la difference.*
